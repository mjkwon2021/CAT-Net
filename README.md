# 😺 CAT-Net

Welcome to the official repository for **Compression Artifact Tracing Network (CAT-Net)**. CAT-Net specializes in detecting and localizing manipulated regions in images by analyzing compression artifacts. This repository provides **code, pretrained/trained weights, and five custom datasets** for image forensics research.

CAT-Net has two versions:
- **CAT-Net v1**: Targets only splicing forgery (WACV 2021).
- **CAT-Net v2**: Extends to general forgery types with mathematical analysis (IJCV 2022).

For more details, refer to the papers below.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mjkwon2021/CAT-Net.git
   cd CAT-Net
```

### 2. Download weights
Pretrained and trained weights can be downloaded from:
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hBEfnFtGG6q_srBHVEmbF3fTq0IhP8jq?usp=sharing)
- [Baiduyun Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hecZC0IZXdgh5WRbRoAytQ) (Extract code: `ycft`)

Place the weights as follows:
```
CAT-Net
├── pretrained_models  (pretrained weights for each stream)
│   ├── DCT_djpeg.pth.tar
│   └── hrnetv2_w48_imagenet_pretrained.pth
├── output  (trained weights for CAT-Net)
│   └── splicing_dataset
│       ├── CAT_DCT_only
│       │   └── DCT_only_v2.pth.tar
│       └── CAT_full
│           ├── CAT_full_v1.pth.tar
│           └── CAT_full_v2.pth.tar
```
- **CAT_full_v1**: WACV model (splicing forgery only).
- **CAT_full_v2**: IJCV model (general forgery).

### 3. Setup environment
```bash
conda create -n cat python=3.6
conda activate cat
conda install pytorch==1.1.0 torchvision==0.3.0 cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Modify configuration files
- Set paths in `project_config.py`.
- Update GPU settings in `experiments/CAT_full.yaml` (e.g., `GPU=(0,)` for single GPU).

---

## 🚀 Inference

### Steps
1. **Prepare Input Images**: Place images in the `input` directory. Use English filenames.
2. **Select Model and Stream**: Modify `tools/infer.py`:
   - Comment/uncomment lines 65-66 and 75-76 to select full CAT-Net or DCT stream.
   - Update lines 65-66 to select v1 or v2 weights.
3. **Run Inference**: At the root of this repository, run:
```bash
python tools/infer.py
```
4. **View Results**: Predictions are saved in the `output_pred` directory as heatmaps.

## 🏗️ Training

### 1. Download tampCOCO / compRAISE datasets

We generated two forgery datasets. Refer to the IJCV paper for details.

- **tampCOCO**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qsii24/tampcoco) or [Baiduyun Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n9nN6cB0FGxsl6VH53CRwQ?pwd=ycft) (Extract code: `ycft`)
  - Contains: `cm_COCO`, `sp_COCO`, `bcm_COCO (=CM RAISE)`, `bcmc_COCO (=CM-JPEG RAISE)`.
  - Follows MS COCO licensing terms.
- **compRAISE**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qsii24/compraise)
  - Also referred to as `JPEG RAISE` in the IJCV paper.
  - Follows RAISE licensing terms.

**Note**: Use datasets for research purposes only.

#### 📦️ Other Training Dataset

Our training settings have become the standard setup for image manipulation (=forgery) detection and localization, which has been referred to as CAT-Net settings or the CAT protocol. CAT-Net settings use five datasets for training: FantasticReality, CASIA v2, IMD2020, TampCOCO, and CompRAISE. Also, the setting uses balanced sampling: see the [[__getitem__ function]](https://github.com/mjkwon2021/CAT-Net/blob/e330b5238e8f6a85133819616b24475807e97784/Splicing/data/data_core.py#L97).

So we provide links to other training datasets.

- **CASIA**: The official link is broken. Use: [[Link to Download]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13jyChWqg_aKMAxqj-0T2SwSxRrUP7V_X?usp=sharing)
 
- **IMD2020**: Official link: [[Link to Download]](https://staff.utia.cas.cz/novozada/db/)

### 2. Prepare datasets
- Obtain the required datasets.
- Configure training/validation paths in `Splicing/data/data_core.py`.
- JPEG-compress non-JPEG images before training. Run dataset-specific scripts (e.g., `Splicing/data/dataset_IMD2020.py`) for automatic compression.
- To add custom datasets, create dataset class files similar to the existing ones.

### 3. Start training
Run the following command at the root of the repository:
```bash
python tools/train.py
```
Training starts from pretrained weights if they are placed properly.

## ©️ License

Update (2026-08-05): Working as a researcher in the industry made me realize that strict "research-only" licenses can actually make it quite difficult for corporate researchers to use open-source work, even for pure internal R&D. Because of this, I've decided to relax the licenses for the CAT-Net weights, as well as the tampCOCO and compRAISE datasets, to CC-BY 4.0. And CAT-Net code to Apache 2.0.

This means you are now free to use them for commercial purposes, provided you give proper attribution.

Please Note: You are still responsible for checking and complying with the copyrights and licenses of the original images used to build the datasets, as well as any third-party code dependencies that CAT-Net relies on. Finally, I (Myung-Joon Kwon) assume no responsibility or liability for any issues arising from the use of the code or data in this repository.
